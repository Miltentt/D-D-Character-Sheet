## Status

As this was my very first bigger sized project, it is currently severly lacking in good coding practices, user safety and performance. I work on the code in my free time to apply everything that I have learnt along the way. It is however the nice representation of my improvment in Android development going from this project -> YoutubeBG, which I'm really happy about.
